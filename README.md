# ðŸŽ² Boardman ðŸŽ²

This is an idea I had for a board game state manager. I want to be able to programatically create a board game using it's rules. Like a person understands a board game from it's set of rules, I want a computer to do the same.

This project is developed in Typescript using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) as a state manager. Tests are done using Jest.
